# Week 01 - Session 01  
## Getting Started with TypeScript

### 🎯 Goal
In this first session, you learned the **fundamentals of TypeScript** — basic types, classes, interfaces, inheritance, and function typing — while setting up your local development environment.

---

### 📂 Project Structure
```
W01-S01/
│
├── circle-class.ts       # Example class with method and property
├── rectangle-class.ts    # Another class demonstrating methods
├── parent-child.ts       # Inheritance example (Shape → Circle, Rectangle)
├── shapes.ts             # Shared structure for shape types
├── function.ts           # Various function examples with typing
└── tsconfig.json         # TypeScript configuration file
```

---

### ⚙️ Setup & Run

1. Navigate to this folder:
   ```bash
   cd W01-S01
   ```

2. Run any `.ts` file directly:
   ```bash
   npx ts-node circle-class.ts
   ```

3. Compile TypeScript (optional):
   ```bash
   npx tsc
   ```

4. Verify configuration:
   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```

---

### 🧩 Concepts Covered
- Type annotations (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, `union`, etc.)
- Interfaces and object typing
- Classes, constructors, and methods
- Inheritance (`extends`, `super`)
- Function typing and optional/default parameters
- Strict mode and type safety (`"strict": true` in `tsconfig.json`)

---

### ✅ Definition of Done (DoD)
- `npx tsc --noEmit` runs with no errors  
- All examples compile and execute successfully  
- Code follows proper TypeScript style conventions  

---

### 🧠 Notes
This session built the **foundation** for all future TypeScript work.  
By mastering typing, interfaces, and classes here, you prepared yourself for working with real-world TS applications in upcoming lessons.
