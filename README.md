## 📘 Overview

This repository documents my personal journey to strengthen TypeScript skills through small, focused exercises and clean coding practices.  
Each subfolder (`W01-S01`, `W01-S02`, etc.) corresponds to a **weekly session** from a 12-month self-directed full-stack roadmap.

The main goals are:
- Building a solid foundation in TypeScript
- Practicing modular and test-driven development
- Applying professional tools: ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, GitHub Actions
- Preparing for remote developer positions through portfolio-ready work
